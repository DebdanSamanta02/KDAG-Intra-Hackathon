KDAG Intras Hackathon- Classifying Benign and Malignant Skin Lesions based on Metadata and Images

## Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
- The Dataset is HIGHLY Imbalanced with 0s making up 99.9% of the data. Thus Oversampling and Undersampling techniques are necessary for evaluation
- Plotting the distribution of features with 'target' label does not give any actionable insights
- Thus the Feature Engineering depends highly on Real-Life Indicators of Malignant Skin Lesions. The Engineered features were generated by ChatGPT as real medical indicators of malignant skin lesions. These features and their credibility were finally verified manually
- Plotting the distribution of the Engineered Features also does not reveal any significant indicatiors. However the correlation plots of the 'target' label v/s the features show that there is significant correlation among the Engineered Features and the Target (more than the original features)
- Finally, since such tasks generally call for Anomaly Detection, on applying PCA to retain 95% variance of 'target' and plotting the 2-axis PCA plot, there is no obvious way to predict anomailes. K-Means with K=2 works poorly, thus we resort to Tabular Inference Models
